## Implementation

When we were thinking about the structure of the site, we were choosing between placing everything on one page and making separate tabs for each object - random combinations, calendar, gallery and so on. We placed everything on one page because we found it more practical for website users: they will be able to see all the functionality of the site at once. They will not have to search through the tabs. Besides, new users do not yet know what the site can offer them, and such an interface will help them get used to the website faster.

There is authorisation and registration available on the website. Users can upload their creations and see other people's works. On the calendar users can track days when the daily challenge was completed.

## About The Project

</p>

Get inspiration is the website that helps creators with practicing their skills on a daily basis.

How does it work? Pretty simple. When someone doesn't know what to draw, one may open our website Get inspiration. Website will show today's random combination of words - one character, one location and one additional detail. This combination of words will be the basis for the future creation. Next, you may create a drawing, a small story or some other work of art. The main requirement: each object from today’s random combination should be included into the creation.

Since one particular combination may not suit you, every day our website generates two combinations so that you can choose between the two.

What is more, Get Inspiration provides you an opportunity to register and mark your daily progress in a personal calendar. Your daily progress is the fact that you have completed today's challenge. As you see how many challenges in a row you have completed, you'll stay motivated not to miss a single day of practicing and improving skills!
